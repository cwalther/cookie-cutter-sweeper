Installing the Inkscape extension

Place the folder cookie-cutter-sweeper in your Inkscape extensions folder. To find where that is, open the Preferences dialog in Inkscape and use the "Open" button under "System > User Extensions". After restarting Inkscape, the extension appears under "Extensions > Export > 3D-Printable Cookie Cutter".

This version of the extension is compatible with Inkscape 1.0. It is not compatible with earlier versions.


Command line usage

For more options, find the "sweep" binary for your platform in the subfolders of cookie-cutter-sweeper and run it on the command line. Running without arguments outputs a usage description.
