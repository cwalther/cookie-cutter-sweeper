Installing the Inkscape extension

Place the file cookie-cutter-sweeper.inx and the folder cookie-cutter-sweeper in your Inkscape extensions folder

On Mac OS X and Linux the extensions folder is at:

  ~/.config/inkscape/extensions

(on Mac OS X, use "Go > Go to Folder" in the Finder and paste this path to reveal the hidden folder)

On Windows it can be found at:

  %APPDATA%\inkscape\extensions

(paste this path into the address line of an Explorer window).

After restarting Inkscape, the extension appears under "Extensions > Export > 3D-Printable Cookie Cutter".


Command line usage

For more options, find the "sweep" binary for your platform in the subfolders of cookie-cutter-sweeper and run it on the command line. Running without arguments outputs a usage description.
